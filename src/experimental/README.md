# About the experimental directory #

These are things that were spinoffs from the main BFF and FOE development effort. They worked at a point in time, but aren't actively supported and we have no plans to develop them further at this time. Although they're not in a fully releasable form, we figured somebody might find some of it useful if they're willing to dig a bit.

This was a student project by Shaun Blackburn. We gave him a copy of BFF 2.6 and asked him to make it work in AWS, which he did. The resulting cloudinit script is here, along with some slides and a readme for background. It worked in the spring of 2013, but we are not actively maintaining it.
